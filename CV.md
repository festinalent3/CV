# CV - Emma Sjöström

I am a Swedish developer who thrives from working with other people. If they share my intense interest in technology, coding and contemplation of pseudo-intellectual questions like “is there a way to implement the truth paradox using a quantum computer”? Coding is a great passion of mine that, like most infatuations, raises more questions than objections. Do I love it because it fits the curious ways of my mind? Is it because I get to solve complex problems on a daily basis? Or is it because GIF:s are accepted as a means of communication between developers? It's probably the GIF:s, but then again, I am a simple woman.

### Technologies I am comfy with (to a various degree)

* Languages
 * Ruby, JavaScript (ES5/ES6), HTML, CSS, Java


* Testing
 * Jasmine, Karma, Protractor, Selenium, Rspec, Capybara


* Libraries/ORMs/others
 * jQuery, Phaser, DataMapper, Bootstrap    


* Frameworks
 * Ruby on Rails, AngularJS, Sinatra


* Other tools
  * Travis CI, Coveralls, [Lingon](https://github.com/spotify/lingon)



So, who am I?

#### Curious and fast to fail
There are very few times I have declined an opportunity to “bite off more than I can chew”.  That’s honestly because I don’t mind failing. In fact, at this point in my life I am really good at both failing and learning so fast that people in general rarely notice I failed in the first place.

Well, not all of us gets to choose our ~~superpowers~~!

#### Autodidact
I am used to acquiring knowledge on my own. One example is when I decided to design and build a couple of websites ([this one](http://littorin.com/) and [this one](http://psykometrika.se/)), without having any prior experience in design, HTML or CSS. I later learnt the art of good code craftsmanship, so please refrain from judging my work based on these two harmless experiments!

Another example is from when I started a degree in Computer Science and we got a tricky problem. I later found out that apparently it had only been solved by one other student before. But, since I didn’t know any better at the time, I figured it out and solved it. (Link to some repo containing the algorithm here). I later ended my studies because I was offered the opportunity to work for the former global CMO of Google, which I did. But that’s different story!

#### Teamplayer
I am and always have been utterly indifferent about what’s at the end of the rainbow. For me, it’s about the small wins on the way, rather than the prestige at the end. In a team, those wins can be amplified if you get the pleasure of working with people who are more experienced than you, but in the best of worlds you get to contribute with your knowledge too. I have also worked with four early stage start-ups (in a different life, as a marketer - [read the full story on LinkedIn, you won't believe what happened next!](https://se.linkedin.com/in/emmasjostrom
)), so I know how the team and team dynamics has a tendency to make or break pretty much everything.

So well, just going to leave this here:

> “I worked close alongside Emma while she was Marketing Director at Spontano. In my eyes Emma is a perfect marketer - enthusiastic, very intelligent, creative, trend-aware and with excellent emotional qualities. Combined with being a dedicated team player and being able to shift focus on different tasks and projects handled simultaneously - she is a valuable asset at any company. For Spontano, Emma created value in many ways; for example, she implemented solutions and routines to create better user retention, created new and managed existing partnerships (i.g Allt Om Stockholm, GuidePal & TaxiStockholm), created and led several marketing campaigns - and she greatly helped with building a good and healthy company culture.”
